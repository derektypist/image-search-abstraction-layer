# Image Search Abstraction Layer

The purpose of the project is to build an image search abstraction layer.

## UX

As a user, I can get the image URLs, description and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given string.

As a user, I can paginate through the responses by adding a `?page=2` parameter to the URL.

As a user, I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

### Information Architecture

There are two fields - term (a string)
